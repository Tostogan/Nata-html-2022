             The HyperText Markup Language or HTML is the standard markup language for documents designed to be displayed 
             in a web browser. 
         <br/>
             It can be assisted by technologies such as Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and scripting languages 
             such as JavaScript.
         <br/>
             Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into 
             multimedia web pages. 
         <br/>
             HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues 
             for the appearance of the document.
         </p>
         <p>
             HTML can embed programs written in a scripting language such as JavaScript, which affects the behavior and 
             content of web pages. 
         <br/>
             The inclusion of CSS defines the look and layout of content. 
         <br/>
             The World Wide Web Consortium (W3C), former maintainer of the HTML and current maintainer of the CSS 
             standards, has encouraged the use of CSS over explicit presentational HTML since 1997.
         </p>
         <h2>
             Hierarchy
         </h2>
         <p>
             The way HTML tags are organized one after the other is called HTML hierarchy. 
         <br/>
             So, far it is clear that these tags build up the structure of a web page. 
         <br/>
             While there are some independent tags, there are also others that are built inside other tags. 
         <br/>
             This one tag above the other tag is called the parent tag of the tag below it, which is called the child tag.
         <br/>
             The series of parent and child tags together form a hierarchy. 
         <br/>
             There are also tags which come side by side and are considered equal, which is why they are called sibling 
             tags.
